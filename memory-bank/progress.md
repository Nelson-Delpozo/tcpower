# Project Progress: Landscaping Waitlist Landing Page

## 1. Overall Status: Planning Phase

We are currently in the initial planning and setup phase of the project. The core Memory Bank documentation is being established.

## 2. Completed Milestones

*   **Memory Bank Initialization (Partial):**
    *   `projectbrief.md` created.
    *   `productContext.md` created.
    *   `systemPatterns.md` created (initial version, needs update).
    *   `techContext.md` created.
    *   `activeContext.md` created.
*   **Initial Technology Stack Decision:** Decided to leverage the existing Remix application.

## 3. Work in Progress

*   **Memory Bank Finalization:**
    *   Creating this `progress.md` file.
    *   Updating `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the Remix-centric architecture.
*   **Gathering User Requirements:**
    *   Neon database setup details.
    *   Landing page content (text, branding, imagery).
    *   Decision on which route to use for the landing page (`_index.tsx` or a new one).

## 4. Planned Next Steps (High-Level Development Workflow)

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   User provides Neon database connection string.
    *   Create `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL`.
2.  **Database Schema:**
    *   Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with `WaitlistEntry` model.
    *   Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name init_waitlist` (or similar).
    *   Run `npx prisma generate`.
3.  **Backend Logic (Remix Action):**
    *   In the chosen route file (e.g., `app/routes/_index.tsx`):
        *   Create an `action` function to handle form POST requests.
        *   Validate incoming email.
        *   Use Prisma client to save the email to the `WaitlistEntry` table.
        *   Return success or error response.
4.  **Frontend UI (Remix Component):**
    *   In the chosen route file:
        *   Create a React component for the landing page.
        *   Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
        *   Include a form with an email input and submit button.
        *   Use Remix's `useActionData` to display success/error messages from the action.
        *   Implement client-side validation as an enhancement.
5.  **Local Testing:**
    *   Run `npm run dev`.
    *   Test signup functionality thoroughly.
6.  **Vercel Deployment:**
    *   User links project to Vercel (`vercel link` if not already done).
    *   Configure `DATABASE_URL` as an environment variable in Vercel project settings.
    *   Deploy using `vercel deploy --prod`.
    *   Test the live deployment.

## 5. Known Issues / Blockers

*   None currently, pending user input for Neon setup and content.

## 6. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

*   Email confirmation to users upon signup.
*   Admin interface to view waitlist.
*   More sophisticated analytics.
